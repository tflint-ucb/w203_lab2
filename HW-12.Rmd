# Regression analysis of YouTube dataset

You want to explain how much the quality of a video affects the number of views it receives on social media. In a world where people can now buy followers and likes, would such an investment increase the number of views that their content receives?  **This is a causal question.** 

You will use a dataset created by Cheng, Dale and Liu at Simon Fraser University.  It includes observations about 9618 videos shared on YouTube.  Please see [this link](http://netsg.cs.sfu.ca/youtubedata/) for details about how the data was collected.

You will use the following variables:

- `views`: the number of views by YouTube users.
- `average_rating`: This is the average of the ratings that the video received, it is a renamed feature from `rate` that is provided in the original dataset. (Notice that this is different from `cout_of_ratings` which is a count of the total number of ratings that a video has received. 
- `length:` the duration of the video in seconds.

a. Perform a brief exploratory data analysis on the data to discover patterns, outliers, or wrong data entries and summarize your findings.

```{r conduct EDA in this chunk}
ggplot(d, aes(x=average_rating)) + geom_histogram(bins = 100)
yt_df<-d[!(d$average_rating==0),]

ggplot(yt_df, aes(x=views)) + geom_histogram(bins = 100)
ggplot(yt_df, aes(x=log(views))) + geom_histogram(bins = 100)
ggplot(yt_df, aes(x=length)) + geom_histogram(bins = 100)
ggplot(yt_df, aes(x=log(length))) + geom_histogram(bins = 100)


```

A lot of entries have a 0 for average rating, this seems unusual since Youtube did not have the option to leave such a rating. If we look at the table, we'll notice that this is because it received no ratings.

It would be a good idea to drop entries without ratings, as 0 will be interpreted as being of low quality, when in reality we don't have information about its quality.

Both views and lengths have some outliers with some very high values. 

b. Based on your EDA, select an appropriate variable transformation (if any) to apply to each of your three variables.  You will fit a model of the type,

$$
  f(\text{views}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 g(\text{rate})  + \beta_3 h(\text{length})
$$ 

Where $f$, $g$ and $h$ are sensible transformations, which might include making *no* transformation. 

```{r fit a regression model here}
model <- lm(log(views) ~ average_rating + log(length), data=yt_df)

stargazer(
  model, 
  type = 'text', 
  se = list(get_robust_se(model))
)
```



c. Using diagnostic plots, background knowledge, and statistical tests, assess all five assumptions of the CLM. When an assumption is violated, state what response you will take.  As part of this process, you should decide what transformation (if any) to apply to each variable. Iterate against your model until your satisfied that at least four of the five assumption have been reasonably addressed.
